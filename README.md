# Unhandled Exceptions and Missing Error Handling in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked issue in Node.js applications: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of an HTTP server that lacks proper error handling, making it vulnerable to crashes and unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` provides an improved version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The `bug.js` server is missing crucial error handling mechanisms.  Unhandled exceptions, network errors, and invalid requests could lead to the server crashing or returning unexpected responses.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates best practices for handling various errors that can occur in an HTTP server:

* **`try...catch` blocks:** Used to gracefully handle exceptions during request processing.
* **Event listeners for errors:** Implement error handling for network issues and other server-side events.
* **Input validation:** Verify incoming requests to prevent unexpected behavior caused by invalid data.
* **Custom error responses:** Provide meaningful error messages to clients.
* **Logging:** Record errors to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

This enhanced error handling ensures the server remains stable and responsive, even under unexpected conditions.
